# Queen

A Discord bot for the Albion Online guild Inglorious Pixels that plays a soundbite from Queen's "Another One Bites the Dust" in Discord voice chat when a guild member gets a kill.

### Video Showcase
[![Showcase](https://img.youtube.com/vi/zFF9b76-SwE/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/zFF9b76-SwE)

Dynamically adjusts intensity of the clip depending on how much fame (exp) the kill was.

Keeps track of the Albion API uptime since it's down so often.

Used some trial-and-error and references to https://www.tools4albion.com/api_info.php and a modified version of https://github.com/psykzz/albion-api.

Sound clips not included in repo because they're in a parent folder `./../sounds` to keep files clean on my PC, since the original version of the bot was coded in Python.

Uses node.js and some Promises and stuff

```
(parent dir)
./
./js
./py
./sounds
...
```
